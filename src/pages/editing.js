        I’m available for editing work and happy to work on projects of all shapes and sizes, from short
        essays to booklength manuscripts. I’ve worked as an editor for the better part of the past decade,
        including in full-time positions at ICA Philadelphia, College Art Association, and Freeman’s.
        Recent projects I’m grateful to have worked on include Stephen Housewright’s <i>Partners</i> and a
        collection of essays about Jerry Hunt, <i>Transmissions from the Pleroma</i> (both Blank Forms,
        2022), a gallery reader for Niki de Saint Phalle’s <i>Joy Revolution</i> at Salon 94 Gallery, and an
        exhibition catalogue for Jammie Holmes’s <i>Pieces of a Ma</i>n at Library Street Collective.
