In 2016 and 2017 I wrote a couple books called Foreign Object and Surface Tension, erotica
novellas that use the spatial, temporal, and behavioral coordinates of astrology to write about
bodies and what we do with them. These were designed by Wilmer Wilson IV and published by
SWAG PURGATORY, and were featured on the bookshelves of the New Museum, Printed
Matter, McNally Jackson, and Ulises, and at various art book fairs. I’m not writing them
anymore, but if you’re interested in purchasing a copy, email me!
