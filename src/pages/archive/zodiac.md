title: "The Zodiac Novels"

In late 2016, I embarked on a new project: one novel for each sign in the zodiac. The books are imagined as quasi-pulp novellas that use the spatial, temporal, and behavioral coordinates of astrology to write about bodies and what we do with them. They are designed by Wilmer Wilson IV and published through the Philadelphia-based publishing realm SWAG PURGATORY.

There will be twelve. So far there are two: Foreign Object: A Novel in Sagittarius and Surface Tension: A Novel in Capricorn.

[Foreign Object](https://www.amazon.com/Foreign-Object-Sagittarius-Zodiac-Novels-ebook/dp/B0713ZHK6S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1508687105&sr=8-2&keywords=heather+holmes+zodiac) and [Surface Tension](https://www.amazon.com/Surface-Tension-Capricorn-Zodiac-Novels-ebook/dp/B071YWDM8Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1508687105&sr=8-1&keywords=heather+holmes+zodiac) are available as Kindle Editions.

The Zodiac Novels are on the bookshelves at the New Museum, Printed Matter and McNally Jackson in New York, and Ulises in Philadelphia.

They have also been featured at the Philadelphia Art Book Fair, the Brooklyn Art Book and Zine Fair, and the Odds & Ends Art Book Fair at Yale University Art Gallery.
